# ShadowReddit

ShadowReddit is an interactive tool that simulates a Reddit thread using AI-generated personas. It helps users reflect on personal or emotional situations by presenting a range of perspectives â€” from empathetic to sarcastic, moralistic to chaotic â€” mirroring the diversity of real Reddit replies.

Built entirely in Go, it uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 to select personas and generate responses, all rendered in real time through WebSockets.
