# ShadowReddit

This project is has been an exercise in how far I can push programming entirely with ChatGPT. Everything except this paragraph and the html.go file has been AI generated. A lot of the code I haven't even reviewed. I am not sure this is a good thing. The more I look at the code the more I want to change parts of it. However, programming this way has allowed me to focus more on my creativity rather than being lost in the syntax all day.

ShadowReddit an interactive tool that simulates a Reddit thread using AI-generated personas. It helps users reflect on personal or emotional situations by presenting a range of perspectives â€” from empathetic to sarcastic, moralistic to chaotic â€” mirroring the diversity of real Reddit replies.

Built entirely in Go, it uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 to select personas and generate responses, all rendered in real time through WebSockets.
